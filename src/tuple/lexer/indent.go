package lexer


//
// TODO provide a lexer that understands indent grammars than use indentation rather than brackets to denote nesting.
//      similar to those used by Occam, Python or Yaml
//      An increase in indentation is equal to an open bracket or brace
//      A  decrease to the previous level of indentation rquals a close bracket or brace
//
