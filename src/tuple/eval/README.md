This package provides a simple (Eval function)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eval] or the backend of an interpretter.

The idea is that you do no have to use this implementation but can use write your own interpretter or
compiler for use with one of the grammars provided in the parser package
or write your own parser and use it with this package.
