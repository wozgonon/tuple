// The basic syntax of command shell parsers is typically very simple:
// everything is a line of strings separated by spaces terminate by a newline.
// Mostly no need for quotes or double quotes or semi-colons.
// This makes it very easy to type command with a few parameters on a command line interface (CLI).
//
// Examples include [TCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl), [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)), DOS cmd shell
// TCL and bash use braces { ... } for nesting.
//
// Bash and DOS of course have lots of extra syntax for working with files but the
// basic syntax typically does not understand arithmetic, with infix notation, one has to use a special tool:
// * TCL has a 'expr' function that understand arithmetic with infix notation
// * Bash one can use an external 'expr(1)' tool:  'expr 8.3 + 6'
// * DOS has a special version of the SET command 'SET /a c=a+b'
